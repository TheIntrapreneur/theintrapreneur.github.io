Welcome to The Intrapreneur! Here you will see ideas, experiences, and cases about the mission that every organization has, to reinvent themselves. Innovation is a topic that has been part of organizations at all levels, even with different approaches companies are looking for a way to keep their relevance for people, society, and the market.

There are perceptions about the innovation and value created by companies. Some of those raise discussions about what is innovation and what value companies are really delivering for their customers. Independently of that perception, humanity is evolving — even faster than before — then people are looking at companies to understand their purpose and what is their place in the world, so customers can join the organization's cause and amplify these companies' relevance.

The Intrapreneur intends to open this discussion on the intrapreneurship topic, and inform more about how companies have to thrive the uncertainties of future investing in processes, people, and new ways to disrupt themselves from the inside out.
