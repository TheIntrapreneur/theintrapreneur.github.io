Probably the most common question about innovation made for innovation leaders is: how to build an innovation culture in an organization? — This question leads to many answers that bring other questions, but after a while, we realize a better question is: how to build an innovation culture to deliver value? — and that question is not simple to answer, and getting it right could make a big difference in the organization.

So, as mentioned before, there are no easy and correct steps you should take, but we can learn a little about some principles and how to classify the efforts by their outcomes. These concepts are bases that might build a good innovation strategy for an organization.

**TL;DR**
*PLEASE UPDATE ME: The term intrapreneurship was used by Steve Jobs to explain the work of the Macintosh team. The four characteristics of intrapreneurship are the need for intrapreneurs, space, resilience, and organizational support. Innovation inside an organization needs intrapreneurship which is not the same as entrepreneurship.*

## The Innovation Principles
To start our journey to answer our big question *"how to create an innovation culture to delivery value?”* — we will first understand what makes that a good one and why we take some time to formulate it.

Independently of the path chosen — running some experiments, or reading good innovation books and posts — it frequently lands on a bunch of tools, practices, how-to, and so on. And there is no problem with that, otherwise, those experiences eventually brought the insight, all of the efforts are divided by the two main principles of innovation: high-value delivery and culture creation.

### Culture creation
The innovation culture creation — also known as the elixir of the long life for the most successful companies — is the first intention of a mature organization. Those organizations have a product or many of them selling in the market, a base of customers, and a revenue established.

// Talks about some tools, and practices of that.
### Value delivery
// Startups focus.
