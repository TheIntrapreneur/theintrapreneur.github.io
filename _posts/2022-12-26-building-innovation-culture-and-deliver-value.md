Intrapreneurship is not a common topic discussed by people during their speech about innovation or career choices compared to entrepreneurship, a close sibling. But it has been part of companies and study fields since Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot coined the term “Intrapreneur” in 1980.

**TL;DR**
*The term intrapreneurship was used by Steve Jobs to explain the work of the Macintosh team. The 4 characteristics of intrapreneurship are the need for intrapreneurs, space, resilience, and organizational support. Innovation inside an organization needs intrapreneurship which is not the same as entrepreneurship.*

First of all, we need to recognize that there are no absolutes about the topic. Some people understand the intrapreneurs as “the inside entrepreneurs”, others believe it’s a different Art with its challenges and ways to approach it.

So, let’s discover more about those challenges and characteristics of intrapreneurship.

## 4 Characteristics of Intrapreneurship
### 1. Innovative organization needs Intrapreneurs
Innovation has been a clear path for organizations to keep their relevance in the market and create new values for customers through technologies and new business models. Therefore, most companies have a strategic investment to discover and build those innovations. But what makes a company best-in-class in innovation is not so clear. However, many of these companies see the same issue, the need for a leader that can drive innovation across the barrier in the company and take the value for the customer. To explain what the Macintosh team has done, Steve Jobs used the new term intrapreneurship.

So, there is no intrapreneurship without intrapreneurs. Since there, the term has been used more frequently in corporations, then in 1992, American Heritage Dictionary added a definition of an intrapreneur.

> A person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation.
