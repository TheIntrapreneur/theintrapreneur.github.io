Intrapreneurship is not a common topic discussed by people during their speech about innovation or career choices compared to entrepreneurship, a close sibling. But it has been part of companies and study fields since Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot coined the term “Intrapreneur” in 1980.


**TL;DR**
*The term intrapreneurship was used by Steve Jobs to explain the work of the Macintosh team. The 4 characteristics of intrapreneurship are the need for intrapreneurs, space, resilience, and organizational support. Innovation inside an organization needs intrapreneurship which is not the same as entrepreneurship.*

First of all, we need to recognize that there are no absolutes about the topic. Some people understand the intrapreneurs as “the inside entrepreneurs”, others believe it’s a different Art with its challenges and ways to approach it.

Both should be right because when the discussion about intrapreneurs started intrapreneurship topic was connected with the job of seeking people with entrepreneurial characteristics that would like to do it inside of organizations. However — over time — it showed other challenges that an entrepreneur never had or will have when running their own business, such as a startup founder never imagining having the volume of resources available for a new business on day #1 and the challenge of managing it in an earlier stage. Another concern that should be addressed is how to use company resources without being corrupted by the old practices of the organization and getting slower to make things happen.

So, let’s discover more about those challenges and characteristics of intrapreneurship.

## 4 Characteristics of Intrapreneurship

### 1. Innovative organization needs Intrapreneurs
Innovation has been a clear path for organizations to keep their relevance in the market and create new values for customers through technologies and new business models. Therefore, most companies have a strategic investment to discover and build those innovations. But what makes a company best-in-class in innovation is not so clear. However, many of these companies see the same issue, the need for a leader that can drive innovation across the barrier in the company and take the value for the customer. To explain what the Macintosh team has done, Steve Jobs used the new term intrapreneurship.

> The Macintosh team was what is commonly known now as intrapreneurship - Jobs, 1985


So, there is no intrapreneurship without intrapreneurs. Since there, the term has been used more frequently in corporations, then in 1992, American Heritage Dictionary added a definition of an intrapreneur.

> A person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation.


### 2. Intrapreneurship needs space

Intrapreneurship is the innovation that happens inside an organization, frequently in big companies. But an established company has a *modus operandi* to protect the core business that does not align with the innovation and freedom needed to create new values that may disrupt the current business. To kill “the cash cows” the intrapreneurship needs space — in some cases — it is an R&D organization apart from the core corporation, a subsidiary in a different building, or a spin-off — the most radical option.

There are *pros and cons* to any of these structures, but this space is necessary to change the *modus operandi,*  then intrapreneurs can challenge and disrupt the core business and be rewarded by doing that. Without this physical and organizational space, intrapreneurship cannot emerge. Usually, intrapreneurs will conflict with the core business. Teams in the business operation have the job of protecting the current model. So new ideas may represent threats to them, and persons who bring them up are seen as a danger in their path. A gap in offering space for intrapreneurship can be a sign that the organization needs to mature in how to handle together, innovation with current business.

### 3. Intrapreneurship needs resilience

Besides the space from the core business, an intrapreneur is an employee of an organization and still working for what is better for the company. Sometimes people see intrapreneurs looking to disrupt the core business as something only better for themselves, but it's not true. Finding a way to disrupt their organization is the best thing they can do. It puts organizations ahead of the industry and makes their business even harder to be disrupted by others. And many startups are trying it.

Another point is the daily bases intrapreneur job. Even with clear communication — about the organization's purpose with intrapreneurship — the *status quo* will be there to remind the intrapreneurs of their waste of corporate assets and their misalignment with the effort of the company to keep the current business running. Then, intrapreneurship should make their work invisible to the organization until it gets results to avoid over-justification. Also, keeping the data about cost, finds, and progression ready to be presented is the key to maintaining necessary support from the intrapreneurship stakeholder.

Playing the game of disrupting and innovating in an established company is a challenge that needs resilience to keep intrapreneurship running until it has proven itself.

### 4. Intrapreneurship needs organizational support

Looking closely at the intrapreneurship mission — to kill “the cash cows” — the total separation of the corporation looks like the better choice, but usually, it’s not the best choice. Companies have valuable assets that any startup would love to access, such as good initial investment, know-how, and areas to support business (e.g., financial. HR, legal, etc.). One of the advantages of innovating from the inside of an organization is to use company resources to accelerate the intrapreneur's work. Another advantage of intrapreneurs in big companies is the long-shot innovation, like researching and developing some technology that is not ready yet or even building an initial small market with a huge impact before any competitor starts to look at that.

But don't get that wrong, the organizational support mains the investment and resource availability. You should not expect people approving intrapreneurs' jobs or even understand the importance of that for the company. Few people accept an established business mission: to fund new business creation for the organization's growth. Having a close alignment with senior executives — C-level or board members — about the goals of intrapreneurship will help to have an agreement to get investment, resources, and support from other areas as soon as needed.

## Conclusion

Intrapreneurship started as a new form of entrepreneurship, but the comparison is no longer working since the evolution and maturity of organizations have shown us the differences in environment, challenges, and benefits of each one.

However, the techniques, processes, and mindsets are helpful for both intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs. They should adapt those elements to their reality and needs. As you can do with this post, take what you want and adjust as you need.
