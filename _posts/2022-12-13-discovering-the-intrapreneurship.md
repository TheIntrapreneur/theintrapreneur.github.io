Intrapreneurship is not a common topic discussed by people during their speech about innovation or career choices compared to entrepreneurship, a close sibling. But it has been part of companies and study fields since Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot coined the term “Intrapreneur” in 1980.


**TL;DR**
*The term intrapreneurship was used by Steve Jobs to explain the work of the Macintosh team. The 4 characteristics of intrapreneurship are: the innovative organization needs intrapreneurs; intrapreneurship needs space, resilience, and organizational support. Innovation inside an organization needs intrapreneurship which is not the same as entrepreneurship.*

First of all, we need to recognize that there are no absolutes about the topic. Some people understand the intrapreneurs as a way to “inside entrepreneur”, and others believe it’s a different Art with its challenges and ways to approach it.

Both should be right because when the discussion about intrapreneurs started intrapreneurship topic was connected with the job to seek for people with the entrepreneurial characteristic that would do it from the inside of organizations. However, over time, it showed other challenges that an entrepreneur never had or will have run their own business, such as a startup founder never imagining having the volume of resources available for a new business on day one and the challenge of managing it in the day one, or how to use this resource without being corrupted by the old practices of the organization and get slow to make things happening.

So, let’s discover the characteristics of intrapreneurship.

## 4 Characteristics of Intrapreneurship

### 1. Innovative organization needs Intrapreneurs
Innovation has been a clear path for organizations to keep their relevance in the market and create new values for customers through technologies and new business models. Therefore, most companies have a strategic investment to discover and build those innovations. But what makes a company best-in-class in innovation is not so clear. However, many of these companies see the same issue, the need for a leader that can drive innovation across the barrier in the company and take the value for the customer. To explain what the Macintosh team has done, Steve Jobs used the new term intrapreneurship.

> The Macintosh team was what is commonly known now as intrapreneurship - Jobs, 1985

So, there is no intrapreneurship without intrapreneurs. Since there, the term has been used more frequently in corporations, then in 1992, American Heritage Dictionary added a definition of an intrapreneur.

> A person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation.


### 2. Intrapreneurship needs space

Intrapreneurship is the innovation that happens inside an organization, frequently in big companies. But an established company has a *modus operandi* to protect the core business that does not align with the innovation and freedom needed to run a business that may disrupt the core of the current business. To kill “the cash cows” intrapreneurship needs space — in some cases — it is an R\&D organization apart from the core corporation, a subsidiary in a different building, or a spin-off, the most radical option.

There are *pros and cons* to any of these structures, but this space is necessary to change the *modus operandi,*  then intrapreneurs to challenge and disrupt the core business, and be rewarded by doing that. Without this physical and organizational space, intrapreneurship cannot emerge. Intrapreneurs will conflict with the core business — that has the job of protecting the current business model — and new ideas represent threats to them, so these ideas and persons are seen as a danger in their path. It could be a signal that the organization needs to mature in how to handle innovation together with current business.

### 3. Intrapreneurship needs resilience

Besides having the space from the core business, an intrapreneur still being an employee of an organization means still working for what is better for the company. Sometimes people see intrapreneurs looking to disrupt the core business as something better for themselves, but it's not true. Finding a way to disrupt their organization is the best thing a leader can do. It puts their organization ahead of the industry and makes their business even harder to be disrupted by others. And many startups are trying it.

Even with clear communication — about the organization's purpose with intrapreneurship —, the status quo will be there to remind the intrapreneurs of their waste of corporate assets and their misalignment with the effort of the company to keep the current business running. Then, keep the work invisible to the organization until it gets results — and at the same time — keep data about the cost and spending because stakeholders will request that to support the intrapreneurship.
Playing the game, disrupting, and innovating in an established company is a challenge that needs resilience to still be in the game over the subject that is not ready.

### 4. Intrapreneurship needs organizational support

Looking closely at the intrapreneurship mission, to kill “the cash cows”, looks like the total separation of the corporation is the best choice, but usually, it’s not the best choice, because companies have some valuable assets that any startup loves to have access, such as good initial investment, know-how, areas to support business (e.g., financial. HR, legal, etc.). One of the big advantages of innovating from the inside of an organization is to get some resources available in this organization to accelerate the intrapreneur's work. Another advantage of intrapreneurs in big companies is the long-shot innovation, like researching and developing some technology that is not ready or even building a market that is small but with a huge impact before any competitor even start to look at that.

Organizational support mains the investment and resource availability, not expecting that people approve of what intrapreneurs are doing, or even understand why it is important for the company. They will not accept that the current business mission is found new business creation, then the organization still growing. Having a close alignment with senior executives — C-level or board members — about the goals of intrapreneurship will help to have an agreement to get investment, resources, and support from other areas when needed.

## Conclusion

The beginning of intrapreneurship starts as a variant of entrepreneurship but with the evolution and maturity of organizations, this comparative no longer helps once there are many differences in the environment, challenges, and benefits of each other.

However, the techniques, processes, and mindsets are helpful for both — intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs — adapting to their reality and needs. Like you can do with this post, get/use what is desired and adapt as you need.
