Intrapreneurship is not a common topic discussed by people during their speech about innovation or career choices compared to entrepreneurship, a close sibling. But it has been part of companies and study fields since Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot coined the term “Intrapreneur” in 1980.

**TL;DR**
*The intrapreneurial is a process divided into two areas and five topics. An 1868 Prang catalog would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll... originat*ed with us \<please updated me>.

First of all, we need to recognize that there are no absolutes about the topic. Some people understand the intrapreneurs as a way to “inside entrepreneur”, and others believe it’s a different Art with its challenges and ways to approach it.

Both should be right because when the discussion about intrapreneurs started intrapreneurship topic was connected with the job to seek for people with the entrepreneurial characteristic that would do it from the inside of organizations. However, over time, it showed other challenges that an entrepreneur never had or will have run their own business, such as a startup founder never imagining having the volume of resources available for a new business on day one and the challenge of managing it in the day one, or how to use this resource without being corrupted by the old practices of the organization and get slow to make things happening.

So, let’s discover the five characteristics of intrapreneurship.

## 5 Characteristics of Intrapreneurship
### 1. Innovative organization needs Intrapreneurs
Innovation has been a clear path for organizations to keep their relevance in the market and create new values for customers through technologies and new business models. Therefore, most companies have a strategic investment to discover and build those innovations. But what makes a company best-in-class in innovation is not so clear. However, many of these companies see the same issue, the need for a leader that can drive innovation across the barrier in the company and take the value for the customer. To explain what the Macintosh team has done, Steve Jobs used the new term intrapreneurship.

So, there is no intrapreneurship without intrapreneurs. Since there, the term has been used more frequently in corporations, then in 1992, American Heritage Dictionary added a definition of an intrapreneur.

> A person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation.


### 2. Intrapreneurship needs space
Intrapreneurship is the innovation that happens inside of an organization, frequently in big companies. But an established company has a *modus operandi* to protect the core business that does not align with the innovation and freedom needed to run a business that may disrupt the core of the current business. To kill “the cash cows” intrapreneurship needs space, in some cases, it is an R\&D organization apart from the core corporation, a subsidiary in a different building, or a spin-off, the most radical option.

There are *pros and cons* to any of these structures, but this space is needed to change the *modus operandi* for intrapreneurs to challenge and disrupt the core business, and be rewarded by doing that. Without this physical and organizational space, intrapreneurship can't raise because intrapreneurs will conflict with the core business that has the job to protect the current business model, and new ideas represent threats to them, so these ideas and persons will be seen as a danger in their path. It could be a signal that the organization needs to mature in how to handle innovation together with current business.
